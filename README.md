# dceconv

The matlab implementation is in the `MATLAB` folder. There are two scripts there:

1. `./MATLAB/a01_percent_error_map.m` - this will evaluate the accuracy of the different convolution implementations
2. `./MATLAB/a02_speed_test.m` - this will compare the computation speed

The julia implementation is in the notebook located in the `Julia` folder. [Click here to see the rendered notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/MPUmri/dceconv/blob/main/Julia/dceConv.ipynb)
